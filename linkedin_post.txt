🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project: Cursor Composer Extractor!

I've built a tool that lets you extract, save, and convert your AI conversations from Cursor (the AI-powered code editor).

🔍 What can it do?
• Extract conversations from Cursor's SQLite database
• Convert rich text to clean Markdown
• Save as individual files or combined JSON documents
• Recover even partial or incomplete conversations

💡 Why I built this:
As I found myself having more valuable conversations with Cursor's AI assistant, I realized there was no built-in way to export or back up these insights. These dialogues are valuable resources that deserve to be preserved!

🛠️ Who is this for?
• Developers using Cursor who want to save their AI pair programming sessions
• Researchers studying LLM interactions
• Teams sharing knowledge from AI assistants
• Anyone analyzing their coding assistance patterns

The tool is completely open-source under MIT license:

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
