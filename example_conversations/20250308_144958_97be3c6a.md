While I understand the appeal of buying Annabelle out, my current lack of regular income makes securing a mortgage challenging, despite having savings. I need to maintain these savings as a financial buffer and carefully consider the tax implications and fees associated with any property transfer.\n+ While I appreciate Annabelle's offer to accept a reduced lump sum of \u00a350,000 for a transfer before February 2025, I have concerns about taking on a mortgage given my current lack of income. Although I have savings, I need to maintain this financial buffer and carefully consider the associated costs and implications of any property transfer.\n  \n- I propose the following approach:\n+ I would like to counter-propose the following approach:\n  \n- 1. We proceed with placing the flat on the market as soon as we reach an agreement\n- 2. I maintain exclusive access and occupancy rights\n- 3. I will take on responsibility for the mortgage payments\n- 4. Annabelle receives her share upon successful sale\n- 5. No interim lump sum payment would be required\n- 6. We put some limits on the influence that the marketing agent has on the sale price, i.e. we don't say in writing that we will accept the price they suggest\n- \n- I have some specific concerns I would appreciate your guidance on:\n- \n- 1. Should we include specific timelines for the marketing and sale process in our agreement?\n- 2. What legal protections can we put in place to ensure my exclusive occupancy rights?\n- 3. Regarding the marketing agent's advice clause - I'm concerned about being bound to accept their recommended sale price. Could we modify or remove this requirement while still maintaining a reasonable minimum sale price?\n- 4. Are there any other legal or financial considerations I should be aware of?\n+ 1. Place the flat on the market once we reach an agreement\n+ 2. I maintain exclusive occupancy rights (with no provision for Annabelle to return to the property)\n+ 3. I will take full responsibility for the mortgage payments going forward\n+ 4. Set a minimum sale price of \u00a3480,000 (rather than \u00a3470,000 as suggested)\n+ 5. Remove the requirement to follow the marketing agent's pricing advice, as this could lead to pressure to accept lower offers\n+ 6. Annabelle to receive her share only upon successful sale\n+ \n+ Regarding your previous suggestion about meeting in the middle on price parameters, perhaps we could include wording that we will \"consider\" the marketing agent's advice for offers above \u00a3480,000, rather than being bound to follow it.\n+ \n+ I would appreciate your guidance on:\n+ 1. The best way to word the marketing agent's involvement without creating binding obligations\n+ 2. What legal protections we need regarding exclusive occupancy\n+ 3. Whether we should include specific marketing and sale timelines\n+ 4. Any other protections we should consider\n  \n- I believe this approach provides a clear path forward while protecting both parties' interests. However, I want to ensure we have addressed all potential complications before proceeding.\n- \n- Thank you for your continued support in this matter.\n+ I believe this approach balances both parties' interests while providing a clear path forward.\n  \n  Best regards,",
