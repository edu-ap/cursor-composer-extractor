The following interview script is designed to elicit all necessary details within a 45-minute meeting.\n+ \n+ ## Conversation Structure and Flow\n+ \n+ This interview is structured in five main phases, designed to efficiently gather all required information:\n+ \n+ 1. **Opening Phase** (2-3 minutes)\n+    - Brief introduction\n+    - Set expectations for the meeting\n+    - Confirm 45-minute timeframe\n+ \n+ 2. **Background Verification** (5-7 minutes)\n+    - Review pre-populated preliminary information\n+    - Confirm department numbers and structure\n+    - Discuss team changes and rankings\n+ \n+ 3. **Market Position Review** (10 minutes)\n+    - Department strengths discussion\n+    - Previous ranking feedback\n+    - Competitor analysis\n+    - Barrister recommendations\n+ \n+ 4. **Matter Review** (20-25 minutes)\n+    This section requires multiple iterations for each matter:\n+    \n+    a) First pass: Review ongoing matters from previous year\n+    - Go through each ongoing matter\n+    - Update status and progress\n+    - Determine if still relevant for inclusion\n+    \n+    b) Second pass: Review newly identified matters\n+    - Assess each potential new matter\n+    - Determine publishable vs confidential status\n+    \n+    c) For each selected matter (new or ongoing):\n+    - Gather client details\n+    - Collect matter specifics (value, jurisdictions, team)\n+    - Document key milestones and outcomes\n+    - Note any awards or press coverage\n+ \n+ 5. **Wrap-up** (2-3 minutes)\n+    - Confirm next steps\n+    - Set timeline for review\n+    - Address any final questions\n+ \n+ Note: The Matter Review section typically takes the longest and may need to be managed carefully to stay within the 45-minute timeframe, especially if there are multiple matters to discuss. Consider prioritizing the most significant matters if time becomes constrained.\n  \n  ## Intro ",
