Stevens & Bolton have a strong team and we feel their Band 1 ranking is justified, but believe we should be ranked alongside them. \n- \n-  \n+ We believe we directly compete with Stevens & Bolton, which is ranked above us. Stevens & Bolton have a strong team and we feel their Band 1 ranking is justified, but believe we should be ranked alongside them.\n  \n- We were disappointed that Irfan Baluch and Pete Kenyon are ranked in Band 3. Both are highly regarded specialist technology lawyers with deep technical expertise valued by our clients. We strongly believe that both Irfan and Pete deserve a Band 1 ranking and are sure our clients would agree. We also believe that Kathryn Rogers should also be ranked, at least in Band 3. \n- \n-  \n+ We were disappointed that Irfan Baluch and Pete Kenyon are ranked in Band 3.

He is an extremely experienced partner who enjoys balancing technically complex and detailed legal work with client relationship management and public speaking. In the last 12 months he has worked on some highly complex technology, AI and privacy projects for large UK FTSE entities and financial institutions, delivering work typically reserved for city firms. We consider that Matthew should be in Band 1.  ",
