# Cursor Composer Extractor - LinkedIn Announcement

I'm excited to share my latest open-source project: Cursor Composer Extractor!

🚀 **Just published**: A new tool for extracting and backing up your AI conversations from Cursor, the AI-powered code editor.

## What is it?
Cursor Composer Extractor gives you access to your conversation history with Cursor's AI assistant, allowing you to:

- 📥 Extract conversations from Cursor's SQLite database
- 📝 Convert rich text to clean Markdown
- 💾 Save as individual files or combined documents
- 🔄 Support multiple output formats (JSON, Markdown)
- 🧩 Recover even partial or incomplete conversations

## Why I built this
As I found myself having more valuable conversations with Cursor's AI assistant, I realized there was no built-in way to export or back up these conversations. The insights and solutions in these dialogues are valuable resources that deserve to be preserved and shared!

## Who is this for?
- Developers using Cursor who want to save their AI conversations
- Researchers studying LLM interactions
- Teams who want to share knowledge from AI pair programming
- Anyone who wants to analyze their coding assistance patterns

## How to get it
The tool is completely open-source under MIT license. Check it out on GitHub:
https://github.com/edu-ap/cursor-composer-extractor

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/edu-ap/cursor-composer-extractor.git
```

I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and contributions!
